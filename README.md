## Setup

From the project root, create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the project in **editable** mode so `scripts` and `app` import without setting `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
```

This installs dependencies from `pyproject.toml` (same set as `requirements.txt`). If you prefer not to use editable install, you can instead run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and keep the repository root on `PYTHONPATH` when running tests or the CLI.

### Streamlit UI

After `pip install -e .`, from the project root:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

See [app/README.md](app/README.md) for UI behavior and options.

Requirements (declared in `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`): `numpy`, `pandas`, `PyYAML`, `pytest`, `streamlit`, `plotly`.

## Running the pipeline

From the project root, with a YAML config (e.g. `example.yaml`):

```bash
# Run as a module (recommended)
python -m scripts.main example.yaml

# Or, with explicit flag
python -m scripts.main -c path/to/config.yaml
```

Output CSV is written under `output/` and includes one row per week with per-channel impressions, spend, revenue, and totals.

---

## Running tests

From the project root, run all tests:

```bash
python test.py
```

Run a single test suite:

```bash
python -m tests.test_config
python -m tests.test_spend_generation
python -m tests.test_impressions_simulation
python -m tests.test_revenue_simulation
python -m tests.test_pipeline
```

Test modules live under `tests/` and mirror the pipeline: config/loading, spend generation, impressions simulation, revenue simulation, and full-pipeline tests.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline takes a user YAML config, merges it with defaults, then runs four steps in order. Data flows as follows:

```
YAML config  →  load_config  →  InputConfigurations
                                      ↓
                              generate_spend  →  spend_matrix (weeks × channels)
                                      ↓
                              generate_impressions(config, spend_matrix)  →  impressions_matrix (weeks × channels)
                                      ↓
                              generate_revenue(config, impressions_matrix)  →  revenue_matrix (weeks × channels)
                                      ↓
                              construct_csv  →  DataFrame  →  CSV file in output/
```

- **Input:** Path to a YAML config file (e.g. `example.yaml`).
- **Output:** A CSV with one row per week: `week`, `revenue` (sum across channels), per-channel `{channel}_impressions`, `{channel}_spend`, `{channel}_revenue`, and `total_impressions`, `total_spend`.

Entry point: `scripts.main` (see [Running the pipeline](#running-the-pipeline)).

---

## 1. Config & loading

**Code:** `scripts/config/loader.py`, `scripts/config/default.yaml`, `scripts/config/defaults.py`, `scripts/synth_input_classes/`

- **What it does:** Reads the user-provided YAML config file and deep-merges it with the project default configuration in `scripts/config/default.yaml` (which provides all required fields and sensible defaults). The loader fills any missing per-channel fields from the default channel template, then passes that template into `InputConfigurations.from_yaml_dict(merged, default_channel_template=...)` so the builder can fill any remaining missing config keys without depending on the config package. The merged config yields an `InputConfigurations` object containing metadata (run id), `week_range`, `channel_list`, and an optional `seed`. If the user specifies fewer channels than `number_of_channels`, additional channels are auto-generated based on the template from `default.yaml`.
- **Key behavior:**
  - If a `seed` is specified in the YAML, the global random number generator (RNG) is initialized accordingly, ensuring reproducible results for all downstream stochastic steps.
  - The `number_of_channels` key allows for the dynamic creation of placeholder channels (named "Generated Channel 1", etc.) modeled from `default.yaml`'s template.
  - Each channel is defined by: `channel_name`, `spend_sampling_gamma_params` (shape, scale), `spend_range`, `true_roi`, `baseline_revenue`, `saturation_config`, `adstock_decay_config`, and `noise_variance`. All of these config dicts are filled from `default.yaml` when missing; noise is applied only to non-config fields (e.g. `true_roi`, `spend_range`) when generating extra channels.
- **default.yaml:** Single source of truth for default channel values. The loader and `scripts/config/defaults.py` (via `get_default_channel_template()`) read it; change this file once to affect all default behavior.
- **Output:** A validated `InputConfigurations` object is produced and provided as input to all subsequent pipeline steps.

---

## 2. Spend generation

**Code:** `scripts/spend_simulation/spend_generation.py`

- **What it does:** For each channel and each week, samples one spend value from that channel’s gamma distribution (using `spend_sampling_gamma_params`), then clips to the channel’s `spend_range`. Uses the config RNG (so the config `seed` controls reproducibility).
- **Input:** `InputConfigurations`.
- **Output:** 2D `np.ndarray` of shape `(num_weeks, num_channels)`; rows = weeks, columns = channels, entries = spend amounts.

---

## 3. Impressions simulation

**Code:** `scripts/impressions_simulation/impressions_generation.py`

- **What it does:** Converts weekly spend per channel into impressions per channel per week, using each channel’s **CPM** and impression noise variance:
  - Base impressions: $\text{impressions} = \frac{\text{spend}}{\text{CPM}} \times 1000$.
  - Adds Gaussian noise with variance proportional to the base impressions and the channel’s `noise_variance["impression"]`.
  - Clips results at 0 so impressions are non‑negative.
- **Input:** `InputConfigurations`, `spend_matrix` (weeks × channels).
- **Output:** 2D `np.ndarray` of shape `(num_weeks, num_channels)` (impressions per week per channel).

---

## 4. Revenue simulation

**Code:** `scripts/revenue_simulation/revenue_generation.py`

- **What it does:** Maps impressions to total weekly revenue across all channels:
  - Applies the channel’s `saturation_config` (e.g. linear = `slope` × impressions with default slope 1, hill, diminishing_returns) to impressions. Skipped when `saturation_enabled: false` (per-channel) or `saturation.global: false`.
  - Applies the channel’s `adstock_decay_config` (geometric/exponential, weighted, or linear = uniform moving average over `lag`+1 weeks when `lag` > 0) to model carry‑over of effects across weeks. Skipped when `adstock_enabled: false` (per-channel) or `adstock.global: false`.
  - Scales by `true_roi` and adds `baseline_revenue`.
  - Adds Gaussian revenue noise controlled by `noise_variance["revenue"]` for each channel.
  - Channels with `enabled: false` short-circuit to zero for the full run (no baseline, no noise, no adstock echo). See [Channel on/off toggles](#6-channel-onoff-toggles).
- **Input:** `InputConfigurations`, `impressions_matrix` (weeks × channels).
- **Output:** 1D `np.ndarray` of length `num_weeks` (one total revenue value per week).

---

## 5. CSV output & full pipeline

**Code:** `scripts/main.py` (`construct_csv`, `main`)

- **What it does:** Builds a pandas DataFrame with columns: `week`, total `revenue`, then for **each channel** (in order) `{channel}_impressions`, `{channel}_spend`, and `{channel}_revenue`, then `total_impressions` and `total_spend`. Saves to `output/{run_identifier}_{timestamp}.csv`.
- **Full pipeline:** Load config → generate spend → generate impressions → generate revenue → construct CSV → write file.

---

## 6. Channel on/off toggles

**Code:** per-channel toggle fields on `scripts/synth_input_classes/channel.py` (`Channel`), global switches on `scripts/synth_input_classes/input_configurations.py` (`InputConfigurations`), and masking applied inside the spend / impressions / revenue generators.

Channels can be turned off entirely or for specific week ranges, and the two modeling effects (adstock carry-over and saturation curves) can be disabled per-channel or globally. All toggles are **fail-open**: any field left unset keeps the channel and its effects fully on, so existing configs continue to run unchanged.

### YAML schema

Each entry under `channel_list` may include optional toggle keys. Everything is optional — omit any of them to stay fully on.

```yaml
channel_list:
  - channel:
      channel_name: TikTok
      # ... the usual fields (cpm, spend_range, saturation_config, etc.) ...

      # Option 1: simple on/off for the whole run.
      # enabled: false

      # Option 2: always on, except during the listed inclusive week ranges.
      enabled:
        default: true
        off_ranges:
          - start_week: 10
            end_week: 12
          - start_week: 30
            end_week: 35

      # Per-channel effect gates (default true).
      adstock_enabled: true
      saturation_enabled: true

# Optional global kill-switches for modeling effects.
adstock:
  global: true      # set false to disable adstock for every channel
saturation:
  global: true      # set false to disable saturation for every channel
```

Rules:

- Weeks are **1-indexed**, and `off_ranges` entries are **inclusive** (`start_week <= end_week`).
- `enabled` accepts either a boolean or a `{default, off_ranges}` mapping.
- Fully disabled channels (`enabled: false`) contribute **zero** revenue across the full run — no spend, no impressions, no adstock echo, no baseline, no noise.
- Globals take precedence: `adstock.global: false` turns off adstock for every channel even if their per-channel flag is true.

### Off-week semantics

During weeks inside an `off_ranges` entry for an otherwise-enabled channel:

- `spend` is masked to 0 (inside `generate_spend`).
- `impressions` are masked to 0 (inside `generate_impressions`).
- `revenue` is **not** zeroed — adstock carry-over from prior active weeks flows through, and `baseline_revenue` + revenue noise still apply. This simulates the realistic "we stopped spending, but past campaigns still echo in the market" behavior.

This means an off-week row can show non-zero `{channel}_revenue` even though `{channel}_spend` and `{channel}_impressions` are zero — that is expected and reflects the decaying tail of earlier spend.

### Minimal example

```yaml
channel_list:
  - channel:
      channel_name: TikTok
      enabled:
        default: true
        off_ranges:
          - start_week: 10
            end_week: 12
      cpm: 25
      # ... rest unchanged ...
  - channel:
      channel_name: LegacyRadio
      enabled: false          # fully off for the whole run
      cpm: 8
      # ... rest unchanged ...
```

### Where masking is applied

| Stage                          | Behavior                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate_spend`               | Zeros spend for fully-disabled channels; zeros off-week cells for partially-off channels. |
| `generate_impressions`         | Inherits zeros from spend; also applies a safety-net mask for off weeks.                  |
| `generate_revenue`             | Short-circuits fully-disabled channels to zero. Applies `adstock_enabled` / `saturation_enabled` gates (combined with global switches). Preserves adstock echo on off weeks (Policy A). |
| `construct_csv`                | No extra masking needed — matrices are already truthful; totals sum the masked columns.   |
